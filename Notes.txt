Java Script
-----------

- How does java script used in both frontend and backend.
  
  * It is due JavaScript Engine

- A JavaScript engine is a software component that executes JavaScript code. The first JavaScript engines were mere interpreters, but all relevant modern engines use just-in-time compilation for improved performance.


Variables
----------
- named memory locations

- 3 types of variable declaration which decides the scope of the variable: var, let, const
	var: global scope, can change
	let: block level scope, can change
	const: constant values, cannot change	

Operators
----------

- Arithmetic operators: ( +, -, /, *, %, ** )

- Relational operators: ( <, >, >=, <=, ==, != )

- Logical operators: ( &&, ||, ! )

- Increment and Decrement operators: ++, --


Type Coercion
-------------

Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers)


Ternary Operator
----------------
- It is a shortcut for writing simple if-else statements. 
- Also known as the Conditional Operator because it works based on a condition.
- The ternary operator allows you to quickly decide between two values depending on whether a condition is true or false.


Syntax:
condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression


Hoisting
---------
- Hoisting is the behavior where the interpreter moves function and variable declarations to the top of their respective scope before executing the code.
- This allows variables to be accessed before declaration, aiding in more flexible coding practices and avoiding “undefined” errors during execution.


Arrow function
--------------

An arrow function is a shorter syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. Introduced in ES6, arrow functions allow for a more concise and readable code, especially in cases of small functions. Unlike regular functions, arrow functions don’t have their own this, but instead, inherit it from the surrounding context.

- Arrow functions are written with the => symbol, which makes them compact.
- They don’t have their own this. They inherit this from the surrounding context.
- For functions with a single expression, the return is implicit, making the code more concise.
- Arrow functions do not have access to the arguments object, which is available in regular functions.
